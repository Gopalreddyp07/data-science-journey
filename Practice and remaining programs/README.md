# Hi there! Welcome to My AI & Data Science Journey

Over the past six months, I've been diving deep into the world of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning — and it's been a fascinating experience.

This GitHub is my digital journal, where I’m documenting everything I’ve learned, practiced, and built along the way — from cleaning raw data to building smart, predictive models.

## My Python Programming Journey

Everything started with Python. I began by learning Python as the foundation for all things data science and AI.

I explored the core concepts including:

- Variables, data types, loops, and conditionals  
- Functions, modules, and file handling  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python  
- Introduction to external libraries like `NumPy`, `Pandas`, and `Matplotlib`

As I grew more confident, I started using Python for real-world problem solving, automation, data analysis, and eventually, building end-to-end AI/ML applications.

Python continues to be my go-to language for all my projects in AI, ML, Deep Learning, and automation.

## Getting Started with Data

I began by mastering the fundamentals of data handling:

- Cleaning messy datasets  
- Dealing with missing values and duplicates  
- Applying preprocessing techniques like encoding and scaling  
- Visualizing trends and patterns for insights  

These skills laid the groundwork for working confidently with real-world data.

## Machine Learning Projects

Once I was comfortable with the basics, I moved into machine learning and built several hands-on projects:

- **Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction**  
  Developed a model to predict passenger satisfaction based on various flight-related features.

- **House Price Prediction**  
  Used regression techniques to estimate house prices using features like location and square footage.

- **Loan Approvals, Customer Churn, and Health Diagnosis**  
  Gained experience with classification models including Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines.

- **Customer Segmentation**  
  Applied clustering algorithms like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to group customers based on behavior.

## Deep Learning Work

As my journey continued, I began exploring deep learning. This part of the journey was both challenging and rewarding.

### Gender Classification with CNN

One standout project involved building a gender classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

- Trained the model on a large dataset of face images.  
- The network learned to identify gender with strong accuracy.  
- This project introduced me to image processing and neural network design.

### Real-Time Stock Price Prediction with RNN

Another interesting challenge was predicting stock prices using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), especially LSTMs.

- Used historical data from companies like Tesla and Google.  
- The model was designed to recognize temporal trends and make short-term forecasts.  
- It gave me practical experience with time series and sequential data modeling.

## Exploring Generative AI

Lately, I’ve started learning about Generative AI — models that can generate new content like text, code, or images.

I'm currently exploring:

- Transformer architectures and how they power tools like ChatGPT  
- Prompt engineering and fine-tuning techniques  
- Tools like LangChain and OpenAI APIs  
- Creative use cases in text generation and image synthesis

## What's Next: Agentic AI

Looking ahead, I’m excited about Agentic AI — systems where autonomous agents can plan, act, and interact with their environment.

I plan to explore:

- Building multi-agent systems using frameworks like AutoGen and CrewAI  
- Developing workflows where AI agents can use tools, make decisions, and collaborate
