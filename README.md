# 👋 Welcome to My AI & Data Science Journey

Over the past 6 months, I’ve been on a focused learning path into the world of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Deep Learning (DL)** — and it’s been an incredible experience!

This repository is a comprehensive collection of everything I’ve studied and built — from foundational concepts to hands-on projects across multiple AI domains. Whether you're a fellow learner or an experienced professional, I hope you find value and inspiration in my work.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Due to GitHub's file size limitations, not all files could be uploaded directly. However, a ZIP file named **`Data Science.zip`** is available in this repository. It contains the complete set of projects, code, datasets, and notebooks. Please download and extract it locally to explore all the work.

## 🌱 Getting Started with Data

I began by learning how to:
- Clean and preprocess messy real-world datasets
- Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers
- Perform feature encoding, scaling, and normalization
- Visualize patterns using matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly

This strong foundation gave me confidence in handling structured and unstructured data across domains.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Projects

After mastering the basics, I applied my skills to a variety of practical machine learning problems:

- **Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction**  
  → Built a model to classify passenger satisfaction using travel-related features.

- **House Price Prediction**  
  → Applied regression techniques to estimate property values.

- **Customer Churn Prediction**  
  → Built classification models using Decision Trees, Random Forests, and SVMs.

## 📚 NLP with Machine Learning Projects

These projects combined traditional ML techniques with natural language processing:

- **SMS Spam Classifier**  
  → Used NLP techniques and ML models to accurately classify text messages as spam or ham.

- **Anime Recommendation System**  
  → Built a content-based recommender using anime descriptions and user preferences.

## 🧠 Deep Learning Adventures

As I progressed into deep learning, I built exciting models using neural networks:

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Gender Classification with CNN  
- Trained a convolutional neural network on thousands of face images.  
- The model accurately classified gender based on image input.  
- This project helped me gain hands-on experience in computer vision and tuning CNNs.

### 📈 Stock Price Prediction with RNN (LSTM)  
- Built an LSTM-based model to predict stock prices for companies like Tesla and Google.  
- Learned time series modeling using historical financial data.  
- Gained practical understanding of sequential data, RNNs, and forecasting.

## 🤖 Currently Learning: Generative AI

I’m currently diving deep into **Generative AI** — exploring how models like GPT can generate content including text, code, and images.

I’m learning about:
- Transformer architectures (BERT, GPT, T5)
- Prompt engineering and fine-tuning LLMs
- LangChain, OpenAI APIs, and GenAI tools
- Use cases in chatbots, writing assistants, and more

## 🧭 What’s Next? Exploring Agentic AI

I’m fascinated by the next frontier in AI: **Agentic AI** — where intelligent agents can:
- Plan and execute tasks
- Use tools and APIs
- Collaborate and make decisions autonomously

I’m exploring frameworks like **AutoGen** and **CrewAI** to build multi-agent systems with real-world applications.
